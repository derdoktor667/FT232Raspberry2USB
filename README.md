This is just a proof of concept switching some Relais using the FT232R by sending ASCII.
Samples available in Python (for easy use on Linux OS) and a PowerShell (Windows 8.1 or newer). No Driver install needed. Windows will get the drivers by Windows Update.

The Scripts donÂ´t contain any error detection or support. Use on your own risk. This maybe will destroy your hardware or do just what it is used to.
